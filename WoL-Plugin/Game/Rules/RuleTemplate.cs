        This is a Template to create new Rules for the Plugin.


        Step 1: Copy this Rule into the correct Category folder and rename the file & class to what you have to do to trigger it.
        You can take a look at the other rules for examples on how to name it.
        Do's:   DutyPops, UseSkill, DieToPlayer
        Dont's: WhenDutyPops, IUseASkill, PlayerKillsYou

        Step 2: Fill out all the Properties below. Some of the properties aren't fully used yet, but its still important to set them.
        Some Properties like "Hint" can also be removed. In those cases, they will either be replaced by a default from RuleBase.cs or just not show up.

        Step 3: Subscribe to any needed handlers in the Start() function and unsubscribe from them in the Stop() function.
        You will always get access to the "Plugin" object, which sets up all the needed handlers. If it does not have the handler you need,
        add it to the Plugin.cs file at the top.

        Step 4: Now, you can write the Check() function. This function hosts all the logic of the Rule.
        Basically, you write a bunch of things to check for one after another, and if the Rule gets triggered, you call the Trigger() function.
        Trigger() always wants a string passed to it, which will show up as the Notification in the bottom right, if Notifications are enabled.

        If you want to take a look at how a Check() could look like - please check the Game/Rules/Social/SayWord.cs
        It's fully commented on what each step does in there.

        If you need any extra variables, you can either add them as public with { get; set; } to make the get saved,
        or have them private with [JsonIgnore] to make sure they do not save.

        Step 5: 
        Once all of this is done, you only need to add your Rule to the Preset.cs file.
        
        Head to Util/Types/Preset and add a property with your new Rule. The format should be obvious from the other ones.

        Once you have done all of this, your Rule should show up in that Category of the Configuration Window ingame.
        Enable it and give it a try if it properly works!
        If you encounter issues, you can always try and use Plugin.Log(3, "Text") to debug any issues you might encounter.
